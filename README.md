# Introduction

A repository for hosting coding challenges.

## Phase I

Please fork our repository to your personal Github account.

## Phase II

There are two images that are identical, though they are identified to the DOM with separate ids.  What is the difference between these two images?

What are the implications for how these images load?

What can be done to make sure image-2 loads correctly with a version?

## Phase II

This page makes a good candidate for using the Bootstrap framework.  Please do the following:

1. Load the Bootstrap framework
2. Theme the page using Bootstrap
3. Ensure the page renders "responsively", for Desktop and Mobile

## Phase III

1. Make a slideshow out of the images.

## Phase IV

Observer employs lots of experiments to measure how users interact with page elements.

1. Conceive of an experiment that you would like to run on this page.  You should conceive of only 1 test.

Using Javascript, demonstrate the ability to do the following:

2. On page load, randomly decide what test group a user will be assigned to -- Control group or the Variation group.  Then, based on this value, render the page appropriately for the test.

# Conclusion

Once you've completed the Phases, please push to your repository.  Add a file answers.txt that provides the written responses to any questions above.
